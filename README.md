### The Track Pacesetting Mini-Robot Car!
## Pitch
During workouts at Track & Field practice, runners are often told to run at a certain pace for the day. Whether that be at 70%, a 2 mile pace, or a set amount of time like 0:30 second 200m, but how do we really know if we’re hitting that? Sometimes there’s someone in the group with a watch that looks at the time after the set but no one knows in real time if we’re actually on pace. What if there was a mini-robot car out at the front that helps us do just that, keep pace and take the right amount of break between sets? That’s what I would like to set out to build, the bot would have a variety of sensors taking in data to help it operate.
The only hardware project I've done before is HackPad but I am very interested in pursuing this over the Summer!

## Features


Big list of items/features I may want to include (_just ideas_!)

Sensors / (Inputs) + What will be done with that data:
(Just a list of ideas right now- some may be redundant but i’m putting my thoughts down so I don’t forget)

- Computer Vision: To stay on line
- Proximity/ distance sensor: Don’t hit humans / objects
- Odometer / encoder: Distance traveled
- Switch: On/off
- Buttons or rotary navigation encoder/ rotary enc: Emergency stop and for operations with led screen
- Bluetooth (maybe wifi)?: Control with phone or to load data, probably usb or offline buttons may be easier to start
- GPS: To assist with the distance traveled odometer
- Gyroscope/compass: Which way are we facing?
- Accelerometer

- Nfc -> Coach can put workout into database, paired to your name. Your tag will contain name, and load up workout will load for you

Random/fun (definitely won’t try in v1 design)
- Temperature: For data collection
- Microphone: Voice commands
- Infrared sensor: For remote control use
- Fingerprint sensor


Other parts:
- Batteries
- laser light for line to run behind
- Microcontroller / pi zero / custom pcbs
- Visibility lights + indicator Leds
- Speaker/buzzer for audible feedback (ex. A countdown to restart)
- USB Port for easy data transfer
- Wheels x4
- Tires x4
- Axles x2
- Motors x4
- Frame + Chassis
- Bumpers
